Code for ICML 2019 paper on Fast and Simple Natural-Gradient Variational Inference with Mixture of Exponential-family Approximations

* To-do List:
  * added a [poster](https://github.com/yorkerlin/VB-MixEF/blob/master/poster_workshop.pdf) about the gradient identities used in the paper (To appear at the ICML workshop on Stein's method) [done]
  * added a [poster](https://github.com/yorkerlin/VB-MixEF/blob/master/poster_main.pdf) of the main paper  [done]  
  * [skewness] added Matlab [code](https://github.com/yorkerlin/VB-MixEF/tree/master/src/matlab/skewness) for the toy example using skew Gaussian and exponentially modified Gaussian [done] 
  * [multi-modality] added Matlab [code](https://github.com/yorkerlin/VB-MixEF/tree/master/src/matlab/multimodality) for the toy example using MoG
  * [heavy tails] To add Matlab code for BLR using t-distribution and  symmetric normal inverse Gaussian
  * To add Python code for Vadam extensions
