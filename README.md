Fast and Simple Natural-Gradient Variational Inference with Mixture of Exponential-family Approximations

* To Do List:
  * add a poster about the gradient identities used in the paper [done] (The ICML workshop on Stein's method) 
  * [skewness] add Matlab code for the toy example using skew Gaussian and exponentially modified Gaussian [done] 
  * [multi-modality] add Matlab code for the toy example using MoG
  * [heavy tails] add Matlab code for BLR using t-distribution and  symmetric normal inverse Gaussian
  * add Python code for Vadam extensions
  * others
